# syntactic_data_generation_HME
This project aim to generate syntactic valid handwritten mathematical expression patterns. The patterns is generated from the CROHME 2014 training set. We decompose the handwritten mathematical expression(HME) patterns in the source dataset to get their structures and then use the structures for generating new semantic patterns.

We publish the generation code as well as the mathematical grammar. The code for the parser is not provided due to private reason. 

The code for generating HMEs is run after the data decomposition step to get the strucutures of all handwritten mathematical expression in the dataset. The file containing the strucutres of HMEs is also provied.

# semantic_data_generation_HME
This project aim to generate semantic handwritten mathematical expression. The dataset is generated from the CROHME 2014 training set. We decompose the handwritten mathematical expression(HME) patterns in the dataset to get their structures and then use the structures for generating new semantic patterns.

The code is run after the data decomposition step to get the strucutures of all handwritten mathematical expression in the dataset. The file containing the strucutres is also provied.
